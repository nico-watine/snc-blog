	☐	move overflow-wrap:break-word from .entry__content p to .entry__content? So that <h> also inherit the rule
	☐	transition:all 0.02s for <a>:hover?

Sketch Doc:
	☐	Define color variables by color or element?
	☐	"tint-white" "shade-black" "tone-gray"

JS:
	☐	is iscroll.js necessary??

Dark Mode:
	☐	Implement css/js method of activating dark mode
	✔	Toggle should only be present for when is light mode, and for people who want dark mode @done (23-02-16 09:14)
	✔	If OS level is set to dark, then only dark should be allowed, hence, hide the toggle @done (23-02-16 09:14)
	☐	Might be possible to offer a light version while OS is in dark mode, but right now that's out of scope
	☐	That would entail having a "body.light" so that it can override all of the prefers-dark-mode styles
